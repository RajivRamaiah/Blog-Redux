# Simple Blog Using redux

I created a simple redux blog where users can create new posts and edit them appropriately so they can communicate with their readers!!! I created three containers, a main container to show a list of posts that the author has made and then two separate containers to create a post and display a post a user clicks on. I also made a single PostsReducer to update the store of the application and trigger updates in the rest of my app when calling the appropriate API functions, like fetches and updates, throughout my app.

I added in CSS design to make the website look a little prettier and added a confirmation box that pops up before a user deletes a blog post. The blog posts support Markdown in their content fields and clicking on an individual blogpost shows an easy-to-read page instead of a barebones black and white blog post.
